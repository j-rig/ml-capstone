    "d. Add useful logging statements at critical points of the code\n",
    "3. Add unit tests to test your various functions and methods. Aim for at least 60%\n",

    "erroneous inputs.\n",
    "4. Ensure that your code runs end-to-end from the command line with appropriate\n",

    "5. Create a README at the top level of your repository documenting exactly how to\n",
    "run your code.\n",
    "6. Submit a link to your production repo containing the refactored and tested code."
