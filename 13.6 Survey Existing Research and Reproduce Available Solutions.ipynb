The authors trained and evaluated several machine learning models on an Airbnb listing dataset from Barcelona. The final model uses a variety of features, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities, as well as the average sentiment score of customer reviews. The authors conclude that their model can be used by Airbnb owners to estimate the expected value of their listings."
