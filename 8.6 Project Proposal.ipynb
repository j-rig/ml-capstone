    "The problem I want to solve is how to accurately evaluate the price of a business for sale. \n",
    "This is an interesting problem because it is complex and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The price of a business depends on many factors, including its financial performance, industry, location, and the overall market conditions. By using NLP to extract relevant information from business listings, such as the business's revenue, profit, industry, and location, we can develop a model that can predict the business price with a high degree of accuracy. This information could then be used by buyers to identify businesses that are undervalued or overpriced."
