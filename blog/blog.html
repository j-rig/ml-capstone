<h2>Intro</h2>
Opening sentence that draws in the reader (ie personal story)
What is the context for the problem weâ€™re solving
Why would this be useful/to whom?
In brief (1/2 sentences max), what are we doing

<p>
The problem I want to solve is how to accurately evaluate the price of
a business for sale.
This is an interesting problem because it is complex and there is no
one-size-fits-all solution.
The price of a business depends on many factors, including its
financial performance, industry, location, and the overall market conditions.
By using NLP to extract relevant information from business listings,
such as the business's revenue, profit, industry, and location,
we can develop a model that can predict the business
price with a high degree of accuracy.
This information could then be used by buyers to identify businesses
that are undervalued or overpriced.
</p>

<p>
This is a supervised learning problem, as I am trying
to predict a continuous value (the business price) based on a set
of predictor variables (such as the business's listing text,
financials, category, and location). I will use a machine
learning model to predict the business price.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

How did you get the data
What does the final dataset look like
Include any decisions that someone would want to know about
(err on the side of being sparse here)


<p>

The data that I will use to solve this problem is the data that
is publicly available on the BuizBuySell website.
This data includes business listings, financial data,
and industry information.
I will acquire this data using web scraping techniques.


Intally used Scrapy to get data
Needed to use Custom Scripts because of scraping/bot protection
www.bizbuysell.coml provided to most high quality data sets for this
project and is the final selection

<h2>EDA</h2>
<p>
 put in data storytelling doc, and write brief explanation of why they are meaningful

 A question to answer each time might be: "Is the takeaway of
 this chart what we expected? If so, why? If not, why might we be seeing this?"

<h2>Feature Importance</h2>

Explain what the most important features are and why that might be.
Again, answer the question: "is this what you expected?
If so, why? If not, why might we be seeing this?"
