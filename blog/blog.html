<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
The problem I want to solve is how to accurately evaluate the price of
a business for sale.
This is an interesting problem because it is complex and there is no
one-size-fits-all solution.
The price of a business depends on many factors, including its
financial performance, industry, location, and the overall market conditions.
By using NLP to extract relevant information from business listings,
such as the business's revenue, profit, industry, and location,
we can develop a model that can predict the business
price with a high degree of accuracy.
This information could then be used by buyers to identify businesses
that are undervalued or overpriced.
</p>

<p>
This is a supervised learning problem, as I am trying
to predict a continuous value (the business price) based on a set
of predictor variables (such as the business's listing text,
financials, category, and location). I will use a machine
learning model to predict the business price.

The data that I will use to solve this problem is the data that
is publicly available on the BuizBuySell website.
This data includes business listings, financial data,
and industry information.
I will acquire this data using web scraping techniques.
